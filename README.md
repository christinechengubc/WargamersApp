# WargamersApp
Originally made for the 2018W2 offering of CPSC 304, the purpose of this app is two-fold:

1. Provide a place for executives of the Wargamers club to update with the latest information about their games to borrow and upcoming events.
2. Allow members of the Wargamers club to view said up-to-date information in a convenient fashion through their phones or on the web.

## Features

* Available on iOS, Android and Web
* Browse all upcoming Wargamers events
* Search and find available games to borrow

## How it works

Executives can log onto the app and use the app as an easy way to add, delete and edit games/events, while members can simply scroll and view the library of games and upcoming events.

* The front-end is built with Ionic Framework (AngularJS, TypeScript), which is based on Apache Cordova. We liked the idea of having a hybrid web-mobile due to its high accessibility and ease of porting it to multiple platforms.
* The back-end is built with Node.js + Express.js (JavaScript) and PostgreSQL. It is then hosted using Heroku to service requests.
